    "### Section 1: Mathematical Derivation\n",
    " \n",
    "Our problem is represented as \n",
    "$$A\\ket{x} = \\ket{b}$$\n",
    "where $\\ket{b} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ is some given quantum state and $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}$. Our goal is to solve for $\\ket{x} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ under a few conditions:\n",
    "- $A$ is hermitian such that $A = A^\\dagger$\n",
    "- $A$ is $s$-sparse and well conditioned, meaning it has at most $s$ nonzero entries per row and its condition number  $\\kappa(A)$ is relatively small such that the system is stable and less sensitive to perturbations.\n",
    "We will break down the derivation into several steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Rewriting**\n",
    "Given that $A$ is a hermitian matrix, there exists a spectral decomposition such that the matrix can be diagonalized by unitary transformations.\n",
    "$$A = UDU^T,\\quad \\text{ where } U \\text{ is a unitary matrix and } D \\text{ is diagonal composed of the real eigenvalues of } A$$\n",
    "Since the columns of $U$ form an orthonormal basis and are the eigenvalues, we can rewrite this decomposition where $|u_{i}\\rangle$ is the $i^{th}$ eigenvector of $A$ with respective eigenvalue $\\lambda_{i}$ as:\n",
    "$$A = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\lambda_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}\\bra{u_{i}}, \\quad \\lambda_{i}\\in\\mathbb{ R }$$\n",
    "Likewise, as a linear transformation, we can write our resultant vector $\\ket{b}$ in the eigenbasis of $A$.\n",
    "$$\\ket{b} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}b_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}, \\quad b_{i}\\in\\mathbb{ C }$$\n",
    "Thus, our problem can now be rewritten as:\n",
    "$$\\ket{x} = A^{-1}\\ket{b} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{i}}b_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}\\bra{u_{i}}u_{i}\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{i}}b_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Quantum Phase Estimation**\n",
    "The problem first boils down to being able to decompose a matrix to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a computationally efficient manner. At a high level, Quantum Phase Estimation is a procedure that performs a series of controlled-$U$ gates given some unitary matrix $U$ with eigenvalues of the form $e^{2\\pi i \\theta}$, and finds $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For HHL, first, we start with two registers $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$ and $\\ket{b}$. Our initial state is thus $\\ket{\\Phi_0} = \\ket{0}^{\\otimes N} \\otimes \\ket{b}.$ Then we can characterize the behavior of **QPE** as:\n",
    "$$\\textbf{QPE}(U,\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N},\\ket{b}) = \\textbf{QPE}(U,\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N},\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\ket{\\lambda_{j}}b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}}, \\quad\\text{ for some clever choice of } U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will choose $U = e^{iAt}$ for some constant $t$ such that $U$ is governed by the same eigenvalues of $A$ and we have that, where $|u_{i}\\rangle$ is the $i^{th}$ eigenvector of $A$ with respective eigenvalue $\\lambda_{i}$:\n",
    "$$U = e^{iAt} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{i\\lambda_{j}t}\\ket{u_j}\\bra{u_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. First, we hadamard our first register of $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes N}$. $H^{\\otimes N}\\ket{\\Phi_0} = \\frac{1}{2^{n/2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})^{\\otimes N} \\otimes \\ket{b}$\n",
    ">2. Next, we perform a series of $N$ controlled-$U$ gates such that for $k = {0, 1,...,N-1}$ (notice $|k| = N$), we create the gate where $\\ket{k}$ is the k-th qubit in the first registrar: \n",
    "$$CU^{2^k}(\\ket{k}, \\ket{b}) =_{\\text{if} \\ket{k}=\\ket{1}} \\ket{k} \\otimes U^{2^k}\\ket{b} = \\ket{k} \\otimes \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{i\\lambda_{j}t2^k}b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}}\\bra{u_{j}}u_{j}\\rangle = \\ket{k} \\otimes \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{i\\lambda_{j}t2^k}b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}} $$\n",
    "The composition of all N of these such gates yields the state (with normalization) where $k = {2^0, 2^1,...,2^{N-1}}$:\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\left( \\left( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n-1}} e^{i k \\lambda_j t} \\ket{k} \\right) \\otimes b_j \\ket{u_j} \\right)$$\n",
    " >3. Now, it is clear that the phase factor actually depends on the control qubits, and so we consider just our first (control) register, which is now superposed through unitary entanglements to the state:\n",
    " $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n-1}} e^{i k \\lambda_j t} \\ket{k} $$\n",
    " $$ \\text{where the phase factor is }\\quad \\lambda_i t = 2\\pi\\theta $$\n",
    " It is clear now that the encoded phase factor we desire (which represents the eigenvalues of $A$), can be extracted through the inverse quantum fourier transform operation. Thus, applying **QFT$^{-1}$** has the following behavior:\n",
    " $$\\textbf{QTF}^{-1}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n-1}} e^{i k \\lambda_j t} \\ket{k}) \\mapsto \\ket{\\theta} \\quad\\text{ which encodes } \\theta_j = \\lambda_j t / 2\\pi$$\n",
    " Thus, for our total state, we are left with:\n",
    " $$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\ket{\\lambda_j}\\otimes b_{j}\\ket{u_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Quantum Phase Estimation**\n",
    "With our new intermediate state $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\ket{\\lambda_{j}} \\otimes b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}} = \\ket{\\lambda} \\otimes \\ket{b}$, our next problem is to \"invert the eigenvalue.\" We will do this by applying a series of controlled rotations. These rotations will utilize the control register which now encodes the eigenvalues applied onto a new ancilla register that will extract $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$. (Checkpoint: by now, we have created 3 registers with a total state of $\\ket{\\lambda} \\otimes \\ket{b} \\otimes \\ket{0}_{ancilla}$\n",
