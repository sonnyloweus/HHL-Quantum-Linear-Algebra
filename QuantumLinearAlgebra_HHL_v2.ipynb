    "### Section 1: Mathematical Derivation\n",
    " \n",
    "Our problem is represented as \n",
    "$$A\\ket{x} = \\ket{b}$$\n",
    "where $\\ket{b} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ is some given quantum state and $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N\\times N}$. Our goal is to solve for $\\ket{x} \\in \\mathbb{C}^N$ under a few conditions:\n",
    "- $A$ is hermitian such that $A = A^\\dagger$\n",
    "- $A$ is $s$-sparse and well conditioned, meaning it has at most $s$ nonzero entries per row and its condition number  $\\kappa(A)$ is relatively small such that the system is stable and less sensitive to perturbations.\n",
    "We will break down the derivation into several steps.\n",
    "- We have access to an \"oracle\" of A in that we have its eigenvalues to use in our circuit (potential weakness).\n",
    "- We assume there exists some efficient algorithm to prepare $\\ket{b}$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Rewriting and Initialization**\n",
    "Given that $A$ is a hermitian matrix, there exists a spectral decomposition such that the matrix can be diagonalized by unitary transformations.\n",
    "$$A = UDU^T,\\quad \\text{ where } U \\text{ is a unitary matrix and } D \\text{ is diagonal composed of the real eigenvalues of } A$$\n",
    "Since the columns of $U$ form an orthonormal basis and are the eigenvalues, we can rewrite this decomposition where $\\ket{u_{j}}$ is the $j^{th}$ eigenvector of $A$ with respective eigenvalue $\\lambda_{j}$ as:\n",
    "$$A = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\lambda_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}\\bra{u_{i}}, \\quad \\lambda_{i}\\in\\mathbb{ R }$$\n",
    "Likewise, as a linear transformation, we can write our resultant vector $\\ket{b}$ in the eigenbasis of $A$.\n",
    "$$\\ket{b} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}b_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}, \\quad b_{i}\\in\\mathbb{ C }$$\n",
    "Thus, our problem can now be rewritten as:\n",
    "$$\\ket{x} = A^{-1}\\ket{b} = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{i}}b_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}\\bra{u_{i}}u_{i}\\rangle = \\sum_{i=0}^{N-1}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{i}}b_{i}\\ket{u_{i}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, note that to represent a state vector $\\ket{b}$ of dimension $N$, to prepare it as a quantum register, we prepare it in binary basis using $\\log_2{N}$ qubits. Therefore, from here on, $N = \\log_2{N}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Quantum Phase Estimation**\n",
    "The problem first boils down to being able to decompose a matrix to find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a computationally efficient manner. At a high level, Quantum Phase Estimation is a procedure that performs a series of controlled-$U$ gates given some unitary matrix $U$ with eigenvalues of the form $e^{2\\pi i \\theta}$, and finds the phase $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of qubits required for QPE is defined by the required additive error epsilon $\\epsilon$, where we will set $n_q = O(\\log{\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}})$ representing the number of qubits needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "For HHL, first, we start with two registers $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes n_q}$ and $\\ket{b}$. Our initial state is thus $\\ket{\\Phi_0} = \\ket{0}^{\\otimes n_q} \\otimes \\ket{b}.$ Then we can characterize the behavior of **QPE** as:\n",
    "$$\\textbf{QPE}(U,\\ket{0}^{\\otimes n_q},\\ket{b}) = \\textbf{QPE}(U,\\ket{0}^{\\otimes n_q},\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}}) = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}b_{j} \\ket{\\tilde{\\lambda_{j}}}_{n_q}  \\ket{u_{j}}, \\quad\\text{ for some clever choice of } U$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We will choose $U = e^{iAt}$ for some constant $t$ such that $U$ is governed by the same eigenvalues of $A$ and we have that, where $\\ket{u_{j}}$ is the $j^{th}$ eigenvector of $A$ with respective eigenvalue $\\lambda_{j}$:\n",
    "$$U = e^{iAt} = \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}e^{i\\lambda_{j}t}\\ket{u_j}\\bra{u_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. First, we hadamard our first register of $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes n_q}$. $H^{\\otimes n_q}\\ket{\\Phi_0} = \\frac{1}{2^{n/2}}(\\ket{0} + \\ket{1})^{\\otimes n_q} \\otimes \\ket{b}$\n",
    ">2. Next, we perform a series of $n_q$ controlled-$U$ gates such that for $k = {0,...,2^{n_q-1}}$, we create the gate (where $\\ket{k}$ is the k-th qubit in the $n_q$ registrar and t is some evolution time): $CU^{2^k}(\\ket{k}, \\ket{b}) =_{\\text{if} \\ket{k}=\\ket{1}} \\ket{k} \\otimes U^{2^k}\\ket{b}$. The composition of all N of these such gates yields the state (with normalization):\n",
    "$$ \\ket{b} \\otimes \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n_q-1}} e^{i k \\lambda_j t} \\ket{k}$$\n",
    " >3. Consider just our $n_q$ (control) register, which is now superposed through unitary entanglements to the state:\n",
    " $$ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n_q-1}} e^{i k \\lambda_j t} \\ket{k} $$\n",
    " $$ \\text{where the phase factor is }\\quad \\lambda_i t = 2\\pi\\theta $$\n",
    " It is clear now that the encoded phase factor we desire (which represents the eigenvalues of $A$), can be extracted through the inverse quantum fourier transform operation. Thus, applying **QFT$^{-1}$** has the following behavior:\n",
    " $$\\textbf{QTF}^{-1}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^n}} \\sum_{k=0}^{2^{n_q-1}} e^{i k \\lambda_j t} \\ket{k}) \\mapsto \\ket{\\theta 2^{n_q}} \\quad\\text{ which encodes } \\theta_j 2^{n_q} = \\lambda_j t / 2\\pi \\quad\\Rightarrow \\tilde{\\lambda_j} = \\frac{\\lambda_j t 2^{n_q}}{2\\pi}$$\n",
    " Thus, we have essentially calculated an approximation of our actual eigenvalues. Thus, for our total state, we are left with a register that by superposition, now encodes an approximation of our eigenvalues into $n_q$ qubits.:\n",
    " $$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}b_{j}\\ket{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}_{n_q}\\ket{u_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Controlled Rotation**\n",
    "With our new intermediate state $\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}b_{j}\\ket{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}_{n_q}\\ket{u_j}$, our next problem is to produce the \"eigenvalues' reciprocal.\" We will do this by applying a series of controlled rotations. These rotations will utilize the control registers from QPE which now encodes the eigenvalues in binary with $n_q$ bits. All rotations will be applied onto a new ancilla register that will aid in extracting $\\frac{1}{\\tilde{\\lambda}}$. (Checkpoint: by now, we have created 3 registers with a total state of $\\ket{\\tilde{\\lambda}}_{n_q} \\otimes \\ket{b}_N \\otimes \\ket{0}_{ancilla}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will encode the ancilla qubit to the following state:\n",
    "$$\\ket{0}_{ancilla} \\mapsto \\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}\\right)^2}\\ket{0}+\\frac{C}{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}\\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$C$ is some constant that corresponds to the success rate of the ancilla being in the state $\\ket{1}$. However, it must not exceed the value of the smallest $\\tilde{\\lambda_j}$ as evident. Therefore, we aim to find the maximal $C$ such that $C < \\min_{j}\\tilde{\\lambda_j}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the general state $\\ket{\\psi} = \\cos(\\theta/2)\\ket{0} + e^{i\\phi}\\sin(\\theta/2)\\ket{1}$ allows us to clearly see that $\\theta_j = 2\\arcsin(C/\\tilde{\\lambda_j}) \\quad \\forall j$. Now, for each angle, we apply the rotation using a multi-controlled gate that triggers if the control QPE register has the encoding of the $\\tilde{\\lambda_j}$ eigenvalue. We know that our reciprocal circuit has succeeded if the ancilla bit is in the state $\\ket{1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Repeated until success, we are left with\n",
    " $$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\ket{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}\\otimes b_{j}\\ket{u_j} \\otimes \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}\\right)^2}\\ket{0}+\\frac{C}{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}\\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **4. Uncompute**\n",
    "Next, we want to uncompute our eigenvalue register by applying the dagger of QPE. This consists of first applying QFT, then simplying applying the conditioned inverse of the unitary matrix $U$ followed by hadamards. We are left with a scaled approximation:\n",
    " $$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\ket{0}\\otimes b_{j}\\ket{u_j} \\otimes \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{C}{\\tilde{\\lambda_j}}\\right)^2}\\ket{0}+\\frac{C}{\\lambda_j}\\ket{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Measure Ancillas**\n",
    "Finally, we will measure the ancilla, which after normalization, yields the post measurement state if our ancilla has the desired outcome of $\\ket{1}$ in the form:\n",
    "$$\\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{j}}b_{j}\\ket{u_{j}}\\ket{1}_{ancilla}$$\n",
    "It is here that we see that this process is not deterministic and can fail up to a probability if our ancilla is in $\\ket{0}$. Thus, we will repeat the process of steps 2-4 until success (ancilla is $\\ket{1}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **6. Extracting Answer**\n",
    "We can see now that our registers hold our solution in the form of $A^{-1}\\ket{b}$. However, since the state $\\ket{x}$ is determined in our registers as a superposition, we cannot measure the full state in one shot without collapsing it to a single basis state. However, by measuring certain observables, you can gain useful information about the state without fully collapsing it. The quantum expectation value $\\bra{x}M\\ket{x}$ for a given observable $M$ is useful in the context of a subroutine because it can allow us to:\n",
    "- obtain information about the solution $\\ket{x}$ for instance, the probability distribution of components of $\\ket{x}$ in a particular basis.\n",
    "- Measure a function of the solution, such as a dot product or a norm, which might be useful in applications without needing the full solution.\n",

Many implementations that exist require manual changes and calculations - our implementation removes this step using quantum circuit composition (a quantum subroutine). Specifically, we perform QPE, extract the respective lambda eigenvalues, and compare them to classically computed eigenvalues. This is what makes the algorithm hybrid.\n",
